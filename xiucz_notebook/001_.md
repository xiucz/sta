        Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  len by supp
W = 575.5, p-value = 0.06449
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

Warning message:
In wilcox.test.default(x = c(15.2, 21.5, 17.6, 9.7, 14.5, 10, 8.2,  :

```
It will give a warning message, saying that “cannot compute exact p-value with tie”. It comes from the assumption of a Wilcoxon test that the responses are continuous. You can suppress this message by adding another argument exact = FALSE, but the result will be the same.
